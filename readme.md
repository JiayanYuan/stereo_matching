Stereo Matching
==================
This repository is an example for stereo matching I've been learning recently. Support both cpu and gpu working.

Pre-requisites
--------------
ROS

CUDA

OpenCV

Datasets
--------
The code is tested on [Kitti dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_stereo.php).

Result
-----
Below shows the disparity and coresponding pointcloud mapping visualized using MeshLab.
